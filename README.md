# Buildsystems for fortran

From fortran-lang.org [resources](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/building_programs/build_tools/) candidates are:

- meson
- scon
- cmake

I will follow the provided tutorial in this project to take an informed decision.

## meson

So far my first experience with it. Looking forward to working with it. I have used ninja before through cmake projects.
meson seams to address key issues I have runned before into from cmake perspective. I think is worth giving it a try.
Here a cool [resources page on how to do X in meson](https://mesonbuild.com/howtox.html).
